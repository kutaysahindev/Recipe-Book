          <li>
            Grate the rind of two lemons into a bowl. Add mint leaves and sugar.
            We crush this mixture by squeezing it with our hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            We squeeze the juice of the two lemons that we grated the peel into
            this mixture. We crush it again with our hands. Then add cold water
            and mix. Filter it with the help of a sieve. A bottle of cool lime
            is ready :)
          </li>
          <li>
            While serving, we throw a few pieces of ice into the glass and serve
            it that way. You should definitely try this practical homemade
            recipe that will cool you down like buzz in cold weather, everyone
            who has already tried it, enjoy it.
